***Introduction to Java***

//What's Java?
-High-level, objected oriented programming language. Developed by Sun Microsystems, now owned by Oracle
-Platform independence, can run on different operationg systems without modification

//Java Feaatures
-Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) if that has Java Virtual Machine 
-Object-Oriented, emphasizing the use of objects and classes
-Platform independence
-Strongly Typed
-Automatic Memory Management
-Rich Standard Library

//Java History
-Created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystem in the early 1990s
-Originally designed for embedded systems but later gained popularity in web  development
-Java has gone through severeal versions, with each bringing new features and improvements

//Usage
-Web development (Java Servlets, JSP)
-Android app development 
-Enterprise software development
-Scientific and financial applications
-Gam development (LibGDX)
-internet of things (loT) projects
-And More

//How to start
-Install the JDK (necessary for writing, compiling, and running Java programs)
-Setting up the IDE (to make the development easier)
-Write simple projects that use basic syntax of Java

***Java Variables and Data Types***

//Variables in Java
-Storing data. Must declare before the use
-Have a data type that defines what kind of data can hold it

//Data Types

Java has two categories of data types: Primitive Data Types: These are basic data types that store single values.
-int: Integer data type (e.g., int age = 25;).
-double: Double-precision floating-point data type (e.g., double price = 19.99;).
-boolean: Boolean data type (e.g., boolean isJavaFun = true;).
-char: Character data type (e.g., char grade = 'A';).
-Reference Data Types: These are more complex data types that reference objects.
-String: Represents a sequence of characters (e.g., String name = "John";).
-Arrays: Collections of data elements (e.g., int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};).

//Variable Naming Rules:
-Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar and myvar are different).
-Variable names must start with a letter, underscore _, or dollar sign $.
-Variable names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
-Variable names should be meaningful and follow a camelCase naming convention (e.g., myVariableName).
